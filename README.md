# Game-challenge

# Brief 

A design challenge to make a game using objects and BEM notation to reinforce learning from the nology consultancy program (week 4). 

I have a created an apple catcher game using javascrpit functionalities and storing variables within objects. 

BEM naming conventions were adopted in the html file structures and were refered to in the javascripit and CSS styling. 

Sass styles directories were also organised in sections and imported into a main sass file for better organisation of code.
