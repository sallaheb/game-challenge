# Game-challenge

# Brief 

A design challenge to make a game using objects and BEM notation to reinforce learning from the nology consultancy program (week 4). 

I have a created apple catcher game using javascrpit functionalities and storing variables within objects. 

BEM naming conventions were adopted in the html file structures and were refered to in the javascripit and CSS.
